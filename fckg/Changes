rev 12-Jun_09-08_00

6 June
Upgraded from FCKeditor 2.4.1 to 2.6.6.  2.6.6 includes the scayt spellchecker, which is an in-editor spellchecker.
2.6.6 is the final FCKeditor before the change-over to CKeditor.  The upgrade required bringing the ie and gecko 
javascript files into sync, in particular so that the image and link dialogs open to a larger size.
This upgrade will now be designated fckgLite 07.

7 June 
Added configuration options for turning SCAYT on and off, setting it as auto,  and for selecting SCAYT language . 
Hide language selection button for SpellerPages spell checker when SCAYT is in effect.

9 June
Converted Arabic language file for fckg editing window from BOM to non-BOM (Corrupted image display).
