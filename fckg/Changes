rev 12-Feb_01-09_33

8 Sep
This distribution marks the changeover to a single distribution of fckgLite based on the jQuery branch of fckgLiteSafe.

14 Sep
Fix to fckdialog.html, where JQuery-like syntax $(id) caused Javascript error in IE 9.  Fixed font plugin,
which failed in FireFox 6 because it fails to recgnize the deprecated font tag.

17 Sep
Some clean-up and minor edits in meta.php and edit.php

18 Sep
Revised method of detecting whether or not an installation of fckgLite is using the upgraded safe encoding
algorithm.

22 Sep
Added short-cut keys: ALT+- for creating new ordered list; ALT+* for creating new unordered list.  The mnemonics are the
Dokuwiki editor's codes for ordered and unordered lists.

23 Sep
Fixes for updated font tool.  Fonts can no longer take DW text formatting.

26 Oct
Fixed bug in nested list, where a list item ending in a link preceding nested item failed to move to
a new line causing the nested item to appear in the saem line as the link.

28 Oct
Upgraded security to deny guest uploads.

30 Oct
Added name="do[save]" to fckg editor's save button 

1 Nov
Removed stet and create functions from FCKeditor plugin tool.  Allows for editing of standard syntax plugins
and for removing <plugin . . .> . . .</plugin> markup from plugins escaped with old create function. 
The latter is for backward compatiblity.

6 Nov
Removed extraneous coding from FCKeditor keypress handling. In fckeditor.html all coding respecting
keypress handling has been removed along with loading of dataEvent.js, and helper.php has been updated to
register keypress events without reference to fckeditor.html.

8 Nov
Changed short-cut keys for insert lists from alt to ctrl to avoid conflicts with European keyboards
and revised get_showButtons (helper.php) for coding efficiency and set it on a 3 second timer
to make sure all inputs have been loaded before event handler has been assigned.

14 Nov
Added exception handling to FCKeditor's FCKDomTools.ClearElementMarkers(), to prevent javascript error messages when
IE is in "IE 9" browser mode; for this to occur "Display notification for every error" must be checked in
the Advanced panel of Internet Options. The errors crop up only in certain list situations.

15 Nov
Added newline after the Dokuwiki forced line-break: \\, so that in the native DW editor these lines appear
on separate lines.

23 Nov
Implemented facility for automatically creating symlinks in fckg/fckeditor/userfiles.  This applies
to Linux systems and to Windows from Vista onward.  This makes it possible now to install fckgLite
using Dokuwiki's plugin manager.  

24 Nov
Edited message for symlink create failure and added auto_install.pdf to fckg/ which explains the 
auto symlink procedures.

25 Nov
Return from meta.php check_userfiles() if userfiles directory is not writable (probably been manually installed).
Updated auto_install.pdf.

28 Nov
German language update for fckgLite editor window

25 Dec
Fixed bug in handling of Samba shares which caused backslashes to be removed in long paths.

5 Jan 2012
Added support in edit php for ftp protocol.

15 Jan 2012
Fixed bug in edit.php which deleted non-Roman characters embedded in DW markup, like bold and italic.
In render_xhtml, where empty markup is removed from ends of lists where acronyms occur (but this should really
no longer apply since acronyms are no longer implemented inside the FCKeditor).

17 Jan 2012
Fixed bug in edit.php which mistook all urls with 'doku.php?id=' as internal dw file; this happened when 
another dokuwiki was being accessed in the url.

29 Jan 2012
Eabled newlines at end of list lines, as in:
            1. this is line one
               new line one and a half
            2. line two   
1 Feb 2012
Chinese language update for configuration options.  From Ian Ko.
